        <p>
            My name is <b>Jaedan</b> and im 19 years old. Im from Cape Cod, <i>Massachusetts.</i> 
            I like anime and video games. <u>Naruto is my favorite anime and Demon Slayer was the best manga ive ever read.</u>
            I have two dogs named Candy and Drako, Drako is a boy and Candy is a girl. I also have a passion for making <b>Youtube videos aswell.</b>
            My major is <u>cyber security</u> and I also went to a technical highschool and did Information technology as my trade. I have a hard time learning how to code ever since highschool, however, html is more familiar to me than python was as I did code in <i>html</i> and some <b>java</b> in highschool.
