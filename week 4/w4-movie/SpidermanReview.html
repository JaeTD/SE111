                <p><em>The Amazing Spider-man 2</em> is a movie that I think was ahead of its time. I think it gets all of the action, humor, and emotion perfect and truly reflects a perfect comic accurate spiderman.
                I think this movies musical score is beautiful and truly makes you FEEL like spiderman himself. Emma Stone also portrays an amazing Gwen Stacy and her and Andrew Garfields chemistyry and dynamic on screen together is perfect.</p>

                <p>My favorite actor in the movie and of all time is Andrew Garfield. I think he plays the best spiderman and peter parker. His humor and expression is just like spiderman and watching him takes me back to my childhood like im watching spiderman stright from the comics on the big screen.
                    Also Andrew Garfield is a chad.</p>

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did you know that while filming The Amazing Spider-man 1 & 2, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield were actually dating in real life for a couple years before unfortunatly breaking up.</li>
                        <li>The reason why Sony never made a third movie was because Andrew was sick and had to call out on a work day so they fired him.</li>
                        <li>Even though this is one of my favorite movies of all time, people argue that its the worst Spider-an movie made and gave it alot of hate upon release ad still to this day.</li>
