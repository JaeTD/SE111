                <p><em>I think this movie is a 10/10. Its plot is interesting and also sneaks in some science aswell. The firs half of the movie starts slow but nessisary to build you up to then get on a suspensful mission in space with the entire planet counting on you. Cooper has to leave his family and friends for the sake of the world and faces MANY trials along the way keeping you on the edge of your seat.</em> </p>

                <p>My favorite actor in the movie is 100% Matthew McConaughey. His preformance as the main character Cooper is amazing. His emotion delievers so well and the ending of the movie with his preformance makes me cry everytime I watch it.  </p>

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The black hole shown in the movie was based off of real physics and is extremley accurate to what a real black hole looks nd acts like in real life.</li>
                        <li>In the beginning of the movie Cooper and his two kids Murph and Tom drive through a corn field. This cornfield was specifically planted just for the film and was 500 acres long.</li>
                        <li>The CGI rendering for the black hole was incredibly complex taking up to 100 hours per frame or 24,000 hours for just 10 seconds of animation</li>
